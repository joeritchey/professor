    Generate a "skeleton" of a document (or embedded document). A
    skeleton is a (unicode) string indicating the keys present in
    a document, but not the values, and is used to group queries
    together which have identical key patterns regardless of the
    particular values used. Keys in the skeleton are always sorted
    lexicographically.

    Raises :class:`~bson.errors.InvalidDocument` when the document
    cannot be converted into a skeleton (this usually indicates that
    the type of a key or value in the document is not known to
    Professor).

    For example:

        >>> skeleton({'hello': 'World'})
        u'{hello}'
        >>> skeleton({'title': 'My Blog Post', 'author': 'Dan Crosta'})
